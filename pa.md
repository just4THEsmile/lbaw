# PA: Product and Presentation

## A9: Product

>Q&A functions as an online discussion hub catering to both seasoned developers and newcomers, fostering knowledge exchange on various topics.

>Within Q&A, users have the liberty to elaborate questions linked to specific categories. Users also possess the ability to contribute answers to questions and engage in discussions via comments. To ensure a self-regulating community, the platform employs a system where users can vote (up or down) on questions or answers, and report any inappropriate content. Community members who garner trust through their reputation points are elegible to gain certain badges and the possibility to become a moderator, which can moderate all content, including editing and deleting others' posts. The platform offers advanced search functionalities, employing matching to scour both question titles and content, and enabling users to refine their searches by filtering through categories.

>This artifact serves to outline the functionalities embedded within our platform, in addition to providing insights into the developmental specifics of the product.

### 3. Application Help

> For starters, whenever anything goes wrong, there will be displayed a message error explaining the reason for the error and how to handle it. For example, if a user wants to create another account unblock request, instead of creating another request, it will display 'Unblock request already exists.'

>Our approach to navigation is to ensure uniform user experience across every page by maintaining consistent layouts for the navigation bar, sidebar and footer, along with standardized color schemes throughout the site.

>Finally, we also implemented icons in certain buttons/links instead of the text, to facilitate the interpretation and readibility. Not only that, but whenever I want to see the user's profile of a question, I can simply press the username, and it will redirect to it's profile.

### 4. Input Validation

> According to our implementation, additionally to using the laravel built-in functions, we also created some php function to validate the inputs. For example, we ask for a minimum of length 8 for the password, or we ask for a minimum of 16 in content of the question.
