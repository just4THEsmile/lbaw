# EAP: Architecture Specification and Prototype

> This element organizes items associated with the high-level architectural plan of the information system under development, as well as the vertical prototype created to confirm the validity of the architecture.

## A7: Web Resources Specification

> This document provides a summary of the web resources intended for inclusion in the vertical prototype, categorized into modules. It's outlined the permissions applied to these modules, defining the access conditions for the resources. The web resources are described according to the OpenAPI standard, detailing the expected URL, supported HTTP methods, parameters, and potential responses for each resource.

### 1. Overview

| Modules | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| M01: Authentication | Web resources associated with user authentication, including system features such as login/logout and registration.|
