### 2. Prototype

We directed our efforts towards developing the high prority features of the project for this prototype, and then the medium ones. There was some emphasis  on the visual aesthetics, resulting in an mostly imperfect design. However, it provides a basic understanding of the layout and ensures easy navigation through the website.
