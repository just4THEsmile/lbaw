## A4: Conceptual Data Model

> This section will explain better the relations between entities that are present in our QthenA project and some database specification.

### 1. Class diagram

> The image below represents a class diagram where it shows the principal entities and their attributes, the relations between them, the domains and rule

### 2. Additional Business Rules
 
> Business rules can be included in the UML diagram as UML notes or in a table in this section.

## A5: Relational Schema, validation and schema refinement

> This portion displays the relational schema derived from the conceptual data model through analysis. It presents each relational schema, along with attributes, domains, primary keys, foreign keys, and essential integrity rules like unique, default, not null, and check constraints.

### 1. Relational Schema

> The Relational Schema includes the relation schemas, attributes, domains, primary keys, foreign keys and other integrity rules: PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, DEFAULT, NOT NULL, CHECK.

Since all relationships adhere to the Boyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF), the relational schema is inherently in BCNF. Hence, there is no need for further normalization of the schema.

## A6: Indexes, triggers, transactions and database population

> The A6 artifact contains the postgres sql code. It contains the physical schema of the database, the database triggers, its population, the identification and characterisation of the indexes.
> It also contains transactions needed to make our features work without problem.

### 1. Database Workload
 
> A study of the predicted system load (database load).
> Estimate of tuples at each relation.

### 2. Proposed Indices

 #### 2.1. Performance Indices
 
> Indices proposed to improve performance of the identified queries at the expense of operations like delete,insert or update but they can greatly increase search time.



| **Index**           | IDX01                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Relation**        | Notification |
| **Attribute**       | appuser_id |
| **Type**            | B-tree             |
| **Cardinality**     | medium
| **Clustering**      | Yes                |
| **Justification**   | The Table is very large, and the queries associated with this index relation are recurrent. It doesn't need range query support so is a very good candidate for clustering as its cardinality is medium.|
|
```sql
    CREATE INDEX notification_user ON Notification USING btree(appuser_id);
    CLUSTER Notification USING notification_user;

```   
| **Index**           | IDX02                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Relation**        | Comment|
| **Attribute**       | commentable_id |
| **Type**            | B-tree             |
| **Cardinality**     | medium
| **Clustering**      | Yes                |
| **Justification**   | The Table is very large,there is a query that searches the comments of a commentable and this query will be repeated a lot so we will make it This is done by exact match, thus an hash type index would be best suited but we need clustering as clustering is not avaiable in hash we choose b-tree.|
|
```sql
    CREATE INDEX comment_commentable ON Comment USING btree(commentable_id);
        CLUSTER Comment USING comment_commentable;

```                
                               
 
| **Index**           | IDX03                               |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Relation**        | Content |
| **Attribute**       | appuser_id |
| **Type**            | B-tree             |
| **Cardinality**     | medium
| **Clustering**      | Yes                |
| **Justification**   | The Table is very large,there are queries that searches for all the commentables (Questions and Awnsers) and this query will be repeated a lot. 
A hash type index would be best suited need clustering as clustering is not avaiable in hash we choose b-tree.|
|
```sql
    CREATE INDEX appuser_content ON Content USING btree(appuser_id);
    CLUSTER Content USING appuser_content;

```   

#### 2.2. Full-text Search Indices 

> The system being developed must provide full-text search features supported by PostgreSQL. Thus, it is necessary to specify the fields where full-text search will be available and the associated setup, namely all necessary configurations, indexes definitions and other relevant details.  

| **Index**           | IDX04                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Relation**        | Tag    |
| **Attribute**       | title ,description   |
| **Type**            | GIN              |
| **Clustering**      | No                |
| **Justification**   | To provide full-text search features for the search of the tag or the description helping to find the tag the user is looking for and minimissing its time, the drawback is that it will take longer to and new tags,delete or update but the tags will be for the most part stable and will only be changed very few times|
| 
```sql
    

```

### 3. Triggers
 
> User-defined functions and trigger procedures that add control structures to the SQL language or perform complex computations, are identified and described to be trusted by the database server. Every kind of function (SQL functions, Stored procedures, Trigger procedures) can take base types, composite types, or combinations of these as arguments (parameters). In addition, every kind of function can return a base type or a composite type. Functions can also be defined to return sets of base or composite values.  

| **Trigger**      | TRIGGER01                              |
| ---              | ---                                    |
| **Description**  | A user can only like a content once. If they vote again, the vote is removed. |

SQL Code: 
```sql         
CREATE FUNCTION enforce_vote() RETURNS TRIGGER AS

>
> The complete code of each script must be included in the group's git repository and links added here.

### A.1. Database schema

> The complete database creation must be included here and also as a script in the repository.

### A.2. Database population
