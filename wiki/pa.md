# PA: Product and Presentation

## A9: Product

> Q&A functions as an online discussion hub catering to both seasoned developers and newcomers, fostering knowledge exchange on various topics.

> Within Q&A, users have the liberty to elaborate questions linked to specific categories. Users also possess the ability to contribute answers to questions and engage in discussions via comments. To ensure a self-regulating community, the platform employs a system where users can vote (up or down) on questions or answers, and report any inappropriate content. Community members who garner trust through their reputation points are elegible to gain certain badges and the possibility to become a moderator, which can moderate all content, including editing and deleting others' posts. The platform offers advanced search functionalities, employing matching to scour both question titles and content, and enabling users to refine their searches by filtering through categories.

> This artifact serves to outline the functionalities embedded within our platform, in addition to providing insights into the developmental specifics of the product.

### 1\. Installation

> Link to the release with the final version of the source code in the group's Git repository.\
> Full Docker Command: docker run -it -p 8000:80 --name=lbaw2357 -e DB_DATABASE="lbaw2357" -e DB_SCHEMA="lbaw2357" -e DB_USERNAME="lbaw2357" -e DB_PASSWORD="EYrQzbEb" git.fe.up.pt:5050/lbaw/lbaw2324/lbaw2357

### 2\. Usage

#### 2.1. Administration Credentials

| Email | Password |
|-------|----------|
| admin@example.com | 1234 |
| moderator@example.com | 12345678 |
| dragon29r@gmail.com | 12345678 |

_Table 71: Administration credentials_

#### 2.2. User Credentials

| Type | Username | Password |
|------|----------|----------|
| Authenticated User | kanderson@example.net | 12345678 |

_Table 72: User credentials_

### 3\. Application Help

> For starters, whenever anything goes wrong, there will be displayed a message error explaining the reason for the error and how to handle it. For example, if a user wants to create another account unblock request, instead of creating another request, it will display 'Unblock request already exists.'

> Our approach to navigation is to ensure uniform user experience across every page by maintaining consistent layouts for the navigation bar, sidebar and footer, along with standardized color schemes throughout the site.

> Finally, we also implemented icons in certain buttons/links instead of the text, to facilitate the interpretation and readibility. Not only that, but whenever I want to see the user's profile of a question, I can simply press the username, and it will redirect to it's profile.

### 4\. Input Validation

> According to our implementation, additionally to using the laravel built-in functions, we also created some php function to validate the inputs. For example, we ask for a minimum of length 8 for the password, or we ask for a minimum of 16 in content of the question we require a unique username and a unique email as well as every tag has an unique name.

### 5\. Check Accessibility and Usability

### 7\. Revisions to the Project

> As we expected, our project suffered major changes since the submission of the er:

#### 7.1 Database

> There were a lot of changes in the database, from the tables itself to the populate, so we thougth that we should resume the most important ones:
>
> * Added 2 new attributes to the user table : _blocked_ and _remember_token_ (for block actions and recover password, respectively. Removed some required's and not null's from the table.
> * Removed some double primary keys from some tables , such as BadgeAttainment. We eventually found a piece of code that could force Laravel to work with double primary keys
> * Added 2 new attributes to the content table : _deleted_ and _blocked_.
> * Changed most tables named id's to id. For example, in the _Question_ table, we changed the id from commentable_id to id.
> * Created a new table named _UnblockAccount_. Used for unblock account apeals that the users do.
> * Removed _select_correct_answer,_ _update_points, generate_answer_notification, generate_comment_notification_ triggers from the database and implemented these in the php.
> * Removed _prevent_self_vote_ trigger as it was the complete opposite of what the business rules asked.
> * Removed _question_minimum_tag_ trigger.
> * Changed the old populate by other one that has way more data and it's slighty more realistic. The following python code is the one that generated the database:
>
> ```python
> from faker import Faker
> import random
> fake = Faker()
> random.seed(0)
