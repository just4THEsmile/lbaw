# ER: Requirements Specification Component

- Project Vision
> The application has in the sight to manage a community of collaborative questions and answers, where anyone can submit questions or answers, in which has the objective to facilitate the discussion of ideas/resources between the users, easing the communication.

## A1: QthenA

- Goals, business context and environment.  
> The primary goal of QthenA is to establish an information system accessible through a web interface, designed for managing a community-driven platform of questions and answers. Registered users have the ability to submit questions and provide answers. The community can then vote on these questions and answers, and users can also add concise comments to either the questions or the answers. Each user is assigned a score, which is calculated based on the votes received for their questions and answers.
> In addition, there will be a team of administrators and moderators responsible for overseeing the application. Their duties include ensuring the smooth operation of the app and promptly addressing any technical issues, as well as monitoring the content to remove illegal materials and taking appropriate actions against users who violate the rules.
- Motivation.  
> In response to the evolving digital and physical landscape, we're crafting a new web application that remakes the way Q&A works. Our motivation is to create an engaging platform where curiosity meets experience. By innovating traditional methods, we're creating a place where asking questions isn't just a search for answers; it's a pathway to deeper understanding and meaningful connections.
